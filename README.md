# Calculation of derivatives of cost function for Convolutional Neural Networks

This is a tutorial on calculation of partial derivatives of cost function with respect to all learnable parameters for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This tutorial is intended for readerswho already have decent (or at least relatively decent) understanding of CNN as here we neitherexplain basics like what different types of layers are needed for, nor we elaborate much on forward pass. Those readers may however be lacking full familiarity with math behind back propagationin convolutional networks and our goal is to remedy that.
