# Calculation of derivatives of cost function for Convolutional Neural Networks

This exercise was driven by pure curiosity rather than practical need. I was curious whether I
can take a relatively simple CNN, calculate partial derivatives of cost function with respect to all
learnable parameters analytically by hand, and then program it without using any ML framework
or autograd library. I did exactly that, trained an image classier, and got the same accuracy as
in TensorFlow. I'm publishing the calculations here in case if anybody, for whatever reason, would
be interested to follow.
